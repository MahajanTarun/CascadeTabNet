# Get Table Structure in JSON Format

### This folder includes the modified version of Table Structure Recognition functions (not all, but few).

The modifications are made to generate JSON file instead of XML. This is very useful in server communication as JSON is eazy to interprete than XML.


Modified python scripts:

* blessFunc.py
* border.py
* main.py
